 * Sample Queries

1. Total Cases by Continent
-> SELECT continent, SUM(total_cases) AS total_cases
   FROM CovidStats JOIN Countries USING(iso_code)
   WHERE date = '2021-12-31'
   GROUP BY continent;

2. Top 5 Countries by New Cases
-> SELECT location, new_cases
   FROM CovidStats JOIN Countries USING(iso_code)
   WHERE date = '2021-12-31'
   ORDER BY new_cases DESC
   LIMIT 5;

3. Monthly Growth of Cases
-> SELECT iso_code, DATE_TRUNC('month', date) AS month,
   MAX(total_cases) - MIN(total_cases) AS growth
   FROM CovidStats
   GROUP BY iso_code, month;

4. Vaccination Rate
-> SELECT location,
   MAX(total_vaccinations) * 100.0 / MAX(population) AS vaccination_rate
   FROM CovidStats JOIN Countries USING(iso_code)
   GROUP BY location
   ORDER BY vaccination_rate DESC;

5. 7-Day Rolling Average (New Cases)
-> SELECT iso_code, date, new_cases,
   AVG(new_cases) OVER (PARTITION BY iso_code ORDER BY date ROWS 6 PRECEDING) AS avg_7d
  FROM CovidStats;
